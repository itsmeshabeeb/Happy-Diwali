                                Hindu religious scriptures, mostly the Puranas. Though the central theme of all legends
                                points out to the classic truth of the victory of the good over the evils, the mode of

                            <br>
                            <p>The first day of Diwali is called Dhanvantari Triodasi or Dhanwantari Triodasi also
                                called
                                Dhan Theras. The second day of Diwali is called Narak Chaturdasi. It is the fourteenth
                                lunar
                                day (thithi) of the dark fortnight of the month of Kartik and the eve of Diwali. On this
                                day
                                Lord Krishna destroyed the demon Narakasur and made the world free from fear. The third
                                day
                                of Diwali is the actual Diwali. This is the day when worship for Mother Lakshmi is
                                performed. On the fourth day of Diwali, Goverdhan Pooja is performed. The fifth day of
                                the
                                Diwali is called Bhratri Dooj. It is a day dedicated to sisters.</p>

                            <p>The Story of Rama and Sita: Lord Rama was a great warrior King who was exiled by his
                                father
                                Dashratha, the King of Ayodhya, along with his wife Sita and his younger brother
                                Lakshman,
                                on his wife's insistence. Lord Rama returned to his Kingdom Ayodhya after 14 years of
                                exile,
                                in which he put an end to the demon Ravana of Lanka, who was a great Pundit, highly
                                learned
                                but still evil dominated his mind. After this victory of Good over Evil, Rama returned
                                to
                                Ayodhya. In Ayodhya, the people welcomed them by lighting rows of clay lamps. So, it is
                                an
                                occasion in honor of Rama's victory over Ravana; of Truth's victory over Evil.

                            <h3>The Story Behind Diwali</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p>The Story of King Bali and Vamana Avatar(the Dwarf): The other story concerns King Bali,
                                who
                                was a generous ruler. But he was also very ambitious. Some of the Gods pleaded Vishnu to
                                check King Bali's power. Vishnu came to earth in the form of a Vamana(dwarf) dressed as
                                a
                                priest. The dwarf approached King Bali and said "You are the ruler of the three worlds:
                                the
                                Earth, the world above the skies and the underworld. Would you give me the space that I
                                could cover with three strides?" King Bali laughed. Surely a dwarf could not cover much
                                ground, thought the King, who agreed to dwarf's request. At this point, the dwarf
                                changed
                                into Vishnu and his three strides covered the Earth, the Skies and the whole Universe!
                                King
                                Bali was sent to the underworld. As part of Diwali celebrations, some Hindus remember
                                King
                                Bali.

                                for what we have, to make special memories with family and friends, to laugh and enjoy

                                time, yet it has continued to be celebrated since the time immemorial. Every year, the
                                festive season of Diwali comes back with all the excitement and merriment. Times may

                                undergone a sea change but customs and traditions remain the same.<br>

                            <p>The main celebration of Diwali takes place on the day of the new Moon, when the sky

                                darkest, so a big part of the celebration revolves around light. Candles, clay
                                lamps, and
                                oil lanterns are lit and placed throughout the home, in the streets, in areas of
                                worship,
                                and floated on lakes and rivers. Fireworks are also set off on the night of
                                Diwali—said by

                                closed (or
                                close early) on Diwali to allow workers to celebrate with their families, too.The

                                be quite extravagant, with the table filled with special dishes and sweets. In honor

                                The origin of Diwali festival is not known, but it has gathered a number of legends
                                around
                                it
                                over the centuries. In the northern and the western regions of India, its origin is
                                attributed to the return of Lord Ram to his kingdom after defeating the demon king
                                Ravana.
                                The joyous people of Ayodhya, his capital, celebrated his arrival. In the eastern
                                states,
                                Diwali is associated with the story of Narakasura who had menaced his people with
                                tyranny.<br>

                                In the regions of Maharashtra and Mysore, Diwali is linked with the legendary king Bali
                                who
                                was immensely popular with his subjects for his generosity. However, king Bali had
                                become
                                arrogant and conceited, and provoked the wrath of godly people. His generosity was put
                                to
                                test by Lord Vishnu who appeared in the disguise of a dwarf, and asked him for a piece
                                of
                                land equal to three steps. When Bali granted his wish, Lord Vishnu took the form of a
                                super
                                giant person, and with his two steps covered Bali's entire kingdom. With his third step
                                he
                                pushed Bali to the underland. Since then, his people celebrated his arrival on this day,
                                locally called Bali Padyami.

                                In the north, most communities observe the custom of lighting lamps. However, in the
                                south,
                                the custom of lighting baked earthen lamps is not so much part of this festival as it is
                                of
                                the Karthikai celebrations a fortnight later. The lights signify a welcome to prosperity
                                in
                                the form of Lakshmi, and the fireworks are supposed to scare away evil spirits.<br>In
                                Punjab, the day following Diwali is known as tikka when sisters make a paste with
                                saffron
                                and rice and place an auspicious mark on their brother's foreheads as a symbolic gesture
                                to
                                ward off all harm.

                                Likewise, on the second day of the month of Kartik, the people of Maharashtra exchange
                                gifts. In Maharashtra, it is the thirteenth day of Ashwin, the trayodasi, that is
                                observed
                                as a festival commemorating a young prince whom Yama, the God of Death, had claimed four
                                days after his marriage. Filled, however, with compassion for the luckless youth, the
                                legend
                                goes, Yama promised that those who observed the day would be spared untimely death-and
                                so
                                the lamps that are lit to mark the festival are placed facing south, unlike on other
                                festive
                                days, because south is the direction mythologically assigned to Yama.

                                divine embodiment of supreme energy. Kali is the Goddess who takes away darkness. She
